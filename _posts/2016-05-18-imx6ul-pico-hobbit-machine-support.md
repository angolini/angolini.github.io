## How to update (or copy) the software

### u-boot

```console
$ export ARCH=arm
$ export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-xxxx
$ make mrproper
$ make pico-imx6ul_defconfig
$ make
```

### kernel

```console
$ export ARCH=arm
$ export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-xxxx
$ make clean
$ make imx_v6_v7_defconfig
$ make -jN (where N is the number of cores of your host PC)
$ make imx6ul-pico-hobbit.dtb
```

### Yocto Project

Add `MACHINE="imx6ul-pico-hobbit"` in your `<build-dir>/conf/local.conf` file and make the image (of your choice)


### Loading

* **Go to serial download mode**

See how on "4.1.3 Changing Hobbitboard boot mode" from [here](http://www.wandboard.org/images/hobbit/hobbitboard-imx6ul-reva1.pdf). Unfortunately it's a PDF and there is no possible cross reference to the exact section

* Using imx_usb, load the (2016.05) u-boot

```console
$ sudo ./imx_usb u-boot.imx
```

* In the board, turn on the UMS utility (connected via serial cable)

```console
> ums 0 mmc 0
```

* In the PC (connected via USB cable) you can now see the partitions mounted like an SDCard.

```console
$ umount /media/user/*
$ sudo dd if=u-boot.imx of=/dev/sdX bs=1K seek=1
```

* or use the image.sdcard generated by BitBake:

```console
$ sudo dd if=image.sdcard of=/dev/sdX
```

* **Turn off, go to eMMC boot, turn on**
